👋 Hi, I’m Sebastian. I am an archaeologist and specialised in the Archaeology of West Asia, Digital and Computational Archaeology and Virtual Reconstructions. I do not code professionally, but always bits and pieces. I am very interested in Reflectance Transformation Imaging and developing my own RTI-Domes. This GitHub should be my place to share everything!
- 🖥️ I have a website here: https://itsmoreofacomment.com/
- 🖥️ I also write on a second blog here: https://archaeoinformatics.net/
- 🖥️ Finally, I am also a freelancer and you can see all I do here: https://www.artefacts-berlin.de/
